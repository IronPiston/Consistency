# Consistency
A resource pack to change some item sprites to their block models. This is done by editing the item models to instead be their block form. Every type of block (door, flower pot, glass pane, etc.) uses a template, so adding new blocks of these types is trivial.

Each item will render as their block form in your inventory, in 1st person, in 3rd person, dropped on the ground, and in item frames.
